# Artist Statement

I chose the rain dataset because, there were so many aspects to visualise ---
from rainfall, to station location, elevation and years. I wanted to explore
the different ways to represent this all in a single artwork.

In terms of a story, I wanted to capsulate or simplify the experience of rain
in a cute manner, which was achieved through pleasing but minimalistic
illustrations and snippets of sound that replicated varying degrees rain.
The usage of the cat added to this aesthetic.

Interaction was made interesting by allowing the viewer to select which rainfall
year they wished to use, and select where the cat would move. This helped
immerse the viewer in the artwork.

In order to make my artwork dynamic, I tried to make interesting audio and visual
additions from simple things like placing the stations at locations corresponding
to their real locations, to changing the background colour, sound and cloud type/size
depending on the amount of rainfall.

After viewing my artwork, I want the viewer to be more informed about Canberra's
rainfall and additionally, also have a better spatial awareness of its geographical
locations. Additionally, I wanted the viewer to reflect on how rainfall might
affect locals/wildlife.
